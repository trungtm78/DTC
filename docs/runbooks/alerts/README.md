# Alerts

One rule per file in `alerts/rules`; one runbook per rule here. `npm run alerts:check` (part of `npm run lint`) fails when a rule has no owner, points at a runbook that does not exist, repeats an id, names a metric or code that nothing in the code emits, is an operations alert routed through the notification module, or when one of the nine mandatory rules is missing.

**The operations channel is independent of the notification module.** An alert about the platform must still reach the on-call people when notifications are the thing that is broken, so `apps/api/src/alerts` has no import path to the notification code (architecture rule `operations-alerts-independent-of-notifications`).
